# BlockDestroyer
An arkanoid or brick breaker clone from the Unity class I'm taking

# Things I've Improved Vs the end fo the Section Lectures
 - Created my own levels

# Things I learned in this section

 - Moving things on the screen based on the mouse

 - Unity World Units as a way to decide where things are in the world. Has to do with the size if your camera.

 - Physics makes the ball fall while collisions make it bounce

 - A trigger collider is used to detect if the player has reached a certain area. Here we use an empty with a collider and make it a trigger in order to know when the ball has been missed by the paddle

 - Learned how to export/import scenes and scripts

 - Learned about right-clicking and refactoring in Visual Studio

 - Learned how to print the score to the screen and how to persist it from one level to another via the Singleton Pattern.

 - Using tags in Unity so that the scripts can do different things to the objects based on the script

 - Makes prefabs vs Duplicates. Prefabs are more useful because they allow you to effect changes across all the instances of the Prefab in the game.
